      <h2>Remember</h2>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          Plan your journey to the assessment - your appointment letter will usually have a map with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your assessor will probably ask you how you got to the assessment. It may affect your claim if your answer seems to contradict the answers given on your form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask for a travel reimbursement claim form at the assessment if you do not already have one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you keep bus/train tickets/receipts or parking tickets/receipts for you and anyone who goes with you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Letters from the DWP</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You need to take your appointment letter and proof of ID to the assessment. Your letter tells you what is acceptable proof of ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your appointment letter tells you about some other things to take such as medical letters, glasses, walking aids etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparing your answers</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If your condition has worsened since you completed the form, get a report/letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.        </li>
        <li>
          Write down points you want to make about your conditions and their impact on you in case they are not covered/asked about by the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down any questions you may have for the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider keeping a diary which you can show the assessor. This will help you track your good and bad days, the impact of any treatment you have, and whether what you do on one day affects how you feel on the next.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>At the assessment</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You can take someone with you to the assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember, the assessor does not decide your entitlement to benefit, they send a report to DWP who decides. You have the right to challenge the outcome of the assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not sure about what you are being asked, ask the assessor for an explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your time to answer questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are asked to do something physical such as bend or stretch, and it causes you any difficulty or pain or you canâ€™t do it, then tell the assessor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you can&#x2019;t attend</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If you can&#x2019;t make it to the appointment you must let the DWP know. If you do not, and you do not go, your benefit will be affected and may be stopped until you do attend an assessment. You will not usually be able to cancel more than one appointment without it affecting your benefit.

          <p><strong>Screen 2: </strong>PIP is a new benefit paid to people who live with long-term disabilities, or long-term health conditions that impact on their daily life. Itâ€™s not designed to help people whose disability or health condition only affect them in the short term. PIP is also claimed by people who are terminally ill, for whom special rules apply.</p>
          <p>Itâ€™s replacing Disability Living Allowance, or DLA, for people aged between 16 and 64.</p>

          <p><strong>Screen 3: </strong>PIP has a â€˜daily livingâ€™ and a â€˜mobilityâ€™ component. There are two rates for each of these components: the standard rate, and the enhanced rate for people who are more severely affected by their condition.</p>
          <p>You can receive payments for both the â€˜daily livingâ€™ and â€˜mobilityâ€™ components, or just one of the two.</p>

              <li>And secondly, for most people, a face-to-face assessment.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>An independent medical professional carries out the assessment. The assessor does not make the final decision on your claim, but makes recommendations to a decision maker from the Department for Work and Pensions, the DWP for short.</p>

          <p>Personal Independence Payment (or PIP, for short) is a new benefit paid to people who live with long-term disabilities, or long-term health conditions that impact on their daily life. It&#x2019;s not designed to help people whose disability or health condition only affect them in the short term.</p>
            <p>PIP is also claimed by people who are terminally ill, for whom different conditions apply.</p>
            <p>It&#x2019;s replacing Disability Living Allowance, or DLA, for people aged between 16 and 64.</p>

          <p>You can received both the daily living and mobility components of PIP, or just one of the two.</p>

            <li>Making a claim for PIP, usually by telephone on <a href="tel:08009172222">0800 917 2222</a> <br/>or by textphone on <a href="tel:08009177777">0800 917 7777</a>.</li>
            <li>Filling in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/259311/pip2-how-your-disability-affects-you-form.pdf" target="_blank">&#x201c;How your condition affects you&#x201d;</a> form, which asks how your disability or health condition makes things difficult for you in daily life.</li>
            <li>Most people also have a face-to-face assessment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An independent medical professional carries out the assessment. The assessor does not make the final decision on your claim, but makes recommendations to a decision maker from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>
