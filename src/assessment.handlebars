      <h2>Remember</h2>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You should plan your journey to the assessment - your appointment letter will usually have a map with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your assessor will probably ask you how you got to the assessment. It may affect your claim if the answer you give seems to contradict the answers given on your form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure to ask for a travel reimbursement claim form at the assessment if you do not already have one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you keep bus/ train tickets/ receipts or parking tickets/ receipts for both yourself and anyone who accompanies you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Letters from the DWP</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You need to take your appointment letter and proof of ID to the assessment. Your letter tells you what is acceptable proof of ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read your appointment letter before you go as it tells you about some other things to take such as new or recent medical letters, glasses, walking aids etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Thinking about the Questions and Preparing Your Answers</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If your condition has worsened since you completed the form, get a report/ letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down points you want to make about your conditions and their impact on you in case they are not covered/asked about by the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down any questions you may have for the assessor about your appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider keeping a diary which you can show the assessor. This will help you track your good and bad days, the impact of any treatment you have, and whether what you do on one day affects how you feel on the next.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>At the assessment</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          Remember, the assessor does not decide your entitlement to benefit, they send a report to DWP who decide.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not sure about what you are being asked, ask the assessor for an explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your time to answer questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are asked to do something physical such as bend or stretch, and it causes you any difficulty or pain or you can&#x2019;t do it, then tell the assessor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you can&#x2019;t attend</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If you can&#x2019;t make it to the appointment you must let the DWP know. If you do not, and you do not go, your benefit will be affected and may be stopped until you do attend an assessment. You will not usually be able to cancel more than one appointment
          without it affecting your benefit.

            <p>This is a guide providing the basic information to help you apply for Personal Independence Payment, PIP for short, for you or someone you care for.</p>
            <p>PIP is a new benefit paid to people who live with long-term disabilities, or long-term health conditions that impact on their daily life. It’s not designed to help people whose disability or health condition only affect them in the short term. PIP is also claimed by people who are terminally ill, for whom different conditions apply.</p>
            <p>It’s replacing Disability Living Allowance, or DLA, for people aged between 16 and 64.</p>
            <p>PIP has a ‘daily living’ and a ‘mobility’ component. There are two rates for each of these components: the standard rate, and the enhanced rate for people who are more severely affected by their condition.</p>
            <p>You can receive payments for both the ‘daily living’ and ‘mobility’ components, or just one of the two.</p>
            <p>To receive PIP you have to go through a process that involves:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Firstly, filling in the ‘How Your Condition Affects You’ form, which asks you how your disability or health condition makes things difficult for you in daily life.</li>
                <li>And secondly, for most people, a face-to-face assessment.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>An independent medical professional carries out the assessment. The assessor does not make the final decision on your claim, but makes recommendations to a decision maker from the Department of Work and Pensions, the DWP for short.</p>
            <p>When making their recommendation, the assessor will consider:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The answers you give on the ‘How Your Condition Affects You’ form.</li>
                <li>All the evidence that you send with the form or provide at the face to face assessment.</li>
                <li>The answers you give at your face-to-face assessment.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>The assessor looks at how your disability or health condition affect the way you carry out a number of different activities.</p>
            <p>These are the activities relating to the daily living aspect:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Preparing food.</li>
                <li>Eating and drinking.</li>
                <li>Managing your treatments.</li>
                <li>Washing and bathing.</li>
                <li>Managing your toilet needs/ continence.</li>
                <li>Dressing and undressing.</li>
                <li>Communicating verbally.</li>
                <li>Reading and understanding written information.</li>
                <li>Mixing with others.</li>
                <li>Making decisions about money.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>These are the activities relating to the mobility aspect:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Planning a journey.</li>
                <li>Moving around</li>
              </ul>
            <p>You will be given a score for each of these activities.</p>
            <p>For example, for the activity ‘dressing and undressing’, if you can dress and undress unaided, you will score 0 points. If you cannot dress or undress at all, this will score 8 points. If you need prompting to select appropriate clothing, or if you need assistance to undress part of your body, you will get a score in between.</p>
            <p>Some other activities, such as moving around, have highest scores of 10 or 12 points.</p>
            <p>Your scores across the activities will be added, and that will decide the recommendation the assessor makes.</p>
            <p>Some tips for you to bear in mind.</p>
            <p>When Filling Out the Form.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Don’t be intimidated by the questions, or by the form’s length. The questions are simple and are not trying to catch you out.</li>
                <li>Give enough detail about how your condition affects you.</li>
                <li>Get help if you need it from a Citizen’s Advice Bureau or advice centre.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Throughout the Assessment</p>
            <p>Don’t put on a brave face when talking about your disability or health condition; be clear about how much it affects you.</p>
            <p>Your condition may change from day to day, be clear about how it impacts on you on your worst day.</p>
            <p>Be aware of what it means to say you are able to carry out a task. Can you do it safely, properly, more than once, and within a reasonable time period? Does it cause you pain when you carry out the task? Make it clear if you use any aids to help you.</p>
            <p>Equally, don’t pretend things are worse than they really are. Knowingly giving false answers as part of a benefit application is benefit fraud, which is a criminal offence.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You should keep copies of your initial application, your ‘How Your Condition Affects You’ form, and all the written evidence that you send or give to the assessor.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Before the assessment:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make a list of your health conditions and disabilities, so that you don’t forget to mention them at the assessment.</li>
                <li>Think about the ways they impact on the daily living and mobility activities the assessment looks at.</li>
                <li>Try taking the test on our website first, where you can save and print off your most important answers!</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Plan your journey to the assessment centre in advance. Don’t be late!</p>
            <p>You have rights at the face to face assessment</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You will be able to claim back reasonable expenses for getting to your assessment.</li>
                <li>You have the right to be accompanied at your assessment. You can ask a relative, friend, carer, or an advocate or support worker to go with you.</li>
                <li>You have a right to complain about the assessment if you don’t think it was conducted fairly.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>You will receive a letter from the DWP telling you the outcome of your application. It will explain how the decision was made, including the points you scored in your test. It will tell you which components you will get, which rates you will receive, and how long it will be until your case will be reassessed.</p>
            <p>Depending on the components and rate of PIP you are entitled to, you might qualify for other benefits or help, for example, the motability scheme.</p>
            <p>If you are unhappy with the decision you have received, you can request a mandatory reconsideration. If, after that, you are still unhappy with the decision, you can appeal against it. We recommend that you get some support for this from a local Citizen’s Advice Bureau or advice centre.</p>
            <p>To start your claim for PIP:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Call the DWP on 0800 917 2222</li>
                <li>or by text phone on 0800 917 7777</li>
              </ul>

        <div id="what-is-PIP" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>Personal Independence Payment (or PIP, for short) is a new benefit paid to people who live with long-term disabilities, or long-term health conditions that impact on their daily life. It&#x2019;s not designed to help people whose disability
            or health condition only affect them in the short term.</p>
          <p>PIP is also claimed by people who are terminally ill, for whom different conditions apply.</p>
          <p>It&#x2019;s replacing Disability Living Allowance, or DLA, for people aged between 16 and 64.</p>

        <div id="rates" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>PIP has a <strong>daily living</strong> and a <strong>mobility</strong> component. There are two rates for each of these components: the standard rate, and the enhanced rate for people who are more severely affected by their condition.</p>
          <p>For more information on Elements and Rates refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pip/what-youll-get" target="_blank">PIP Information page on gov.uk</a></p>

        <div id="applying-for-pip" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>To receive PIP you have to go through a process that involves:</p>
          <ul class="ticks">
            <li>Firstly, making a claim for PIP, usually by telephone</li>
            <li>Secondly, filling in the &#x201c;How Your Condition Affects You&#x201d; form, which asks you how your disability or health condition makes things difficult for you in daily life.</li>
            <li>And thirdly, for most people, a face-to-face assessment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An independent medical professional carries out the assessment. The assessor does not make the final decision on your claim, but makes recommendations to a decision maker from the Department of Work and Pensions, or the DWP for short.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><button aria-controls="looks-at" aria-expanded="false">What the assessor looks at</button></h2>
        <div id="looks-at" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>When making their recommendation, the assessor will consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The answers you give on the &#x201c;How Your Condition Affects You&#x201d; form</li>
            <li>All the evidence that you send with the form or provide at the face to face assessment</li>
            <li>The answers you give at your face-to-face assessment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The assessor considers how your disability or health conditions affect the way you carry out a number of different activities. These activities fall under the categories <strong>Daily Living</strong> and <strong>Mobility</strong>.</p>
          <p>You will be given a score for each of these activities.</p>
          <p>For example, for the activity &#x201c;dressing and undressing&#x201d;, if you can dress and undress unaided, you will score 0 points. If you cannot dress or undress at all, this will score 8 points. If you need prompting to select appropriate
            clothing, or if you need assistance to undress part of your body, you will get a score in between.</p>
          <p>Your scores across the activities will be added, and that will decide the recommendation the assessor makes.</p>

            <li>If your condition has worsened since you completed the form, get a report/ letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.</li>
