<h3>Remember</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You know how to get to the assessment centre and where it is - your appointment letter will usually have a map with it.</li>
  <li>You need to take your appointment letter and proof of ID &#40;your letter tells you what is acceptable proof of ID&#41;.</li>
  <li>Make sure to ask for a travel reimbursement claim form at the assessment if you do not already have one.</li>
  <li>Make sure you keep tickets or receipts about bus tickets, parking receipts for both yourself and any companion who accompanies you.</li>
  <li>To read your appointment letter before you go as it tells you about some other things to take such as new or recent medical letters, glasses, walking aids etc.</li>
  <li>Write down any questions you may have for the assessor about your appointment.</li>
  <li>Write down points you want to make, in case they are not covered/asked by the assessor.</li>
  <li>If you need an interpreter or signer you need to arrange this before the appointment.</li>
  <li>The assessor does not decide your entitlement to benefit, they send a report to DWP who decides.</li>
  <li>If you are not sure about what you are being asked, ask the assessor for an explanation and take your time to answer questions.</li>
  <li>If you are asked to do something physical such as bend/stretch and it causes you any difficulty or pain or you can&#x2019;t do it, then tell the assessor.</li>
  <li>If you do not go your benefit will be affected and may stop until you attend a medical assessment. So if you can&#x2019;t make it to the appointment you must let them know. You will not usually be able to cancel more than one appointment without it affecting your benefit.</li>
